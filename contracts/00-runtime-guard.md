## Overview

This contract defines the runtime behavior and guarantees for Lucidbase projects. It serves as the single source of truth for runtime expectations and drift detection.

## Runtime Guarantees

### 1. Service Availability
- **Uptime Target:** 99.9% monthly availability
- **Response Time:** < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Error Rate:** < 0.1% for non-5xx errors

### 2. Data Consistency
- **ACID Compliance:** All database transactions must maintain ACID properties
- **Eventual Consistency:** Distributed systems must converge within 30 seconds
- **Backup Frequency:** Daily automated backups with 30-day retention

### 3. Security Requirements
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry and refresh tokens
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
- **Data Encryption:** TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Audit Logging:** All security-relevant events logged with immutable audit trail

### 4. Performance Standards
- **Memory Usage:** < 80% of allocated memory under normal load
- **CPU Usage:** < 70% sustained CPU usage
- **Disk I/O:** < 80% of available disk throughput
- **Network I/O:** Graceful degradation under network congestion

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Health Checks:** /health endpoint must respond within 5 seconds
- **Metrics Collection:** Prometheus-compatible metrics with 15-second granularity
- **Log Aggregation:** Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Alert Response:** Critical alerts acknowledged within 15 minutes

### 6. Deployment Standards
- **Zero Downtime:** Rolling deployments with health check validation
- **Rollback Capability:** Automated rollback on health check failures
- **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific configs with validation
- **Dependency Management:** Pinned versions with security scanning

## Compliance Requirements

### 1. Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance:** Right to erasure, data portability, consent management
- **CCPA Compliance:** Consumer rights, data transparency, opt-out mechanisms
- **SOC 2 Type II:** Annual compliance audit with documented controls

### 2. Operational Excellence
- **Incident Response:** 24/7 on-call rotation with escalation procedures
- **Change Management:** All changes require peer review and automated testing
- **Documentation:** API documentation, runbooks, and architecture diagrams
- **Training:** Security awareness and operational procedures training

## Drift Detection

This contract is automatically validated against runtime behavior through:
- Continuous integration checks
- Automated drift detection workflows
- Runtime monitoring and alerting
- Regular compliance audits

## Version Control

- **Semantic Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
- **Breaking Changes:** Require MAJOR version increment and migration plan
- **Backward Compatibility:** MINOR and PATCH versions maintain API compatibility
- **Deprecation Notice:** 6-month notice period for breaking changes

## Enforcement

Violations of this contract will trigger:
1. Automated alerts to the engineering team
2. Blocking of deployments until resolved
3. Escalation to technical leadership
4. Documentation of incident and remediation
